Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Upgrade your ship with items from shop!
Be careful. Hitpoints mustn't go down to 0!

Good luck!`;

const guide = `Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Npcs in the bottom of the list are dangerous!
If hitpoints (green line) drop to 0, your 
ship will be destroyed and progress lost.

Enemy kills give you exp, btc and plt.
With btc and plt buy equipment in shop. 
Experience increase your lvl and rank.

Guns increase your damage. Shields and 
ship upgrades increase your total hitpoints.

You can have maximum 6 guns and shields, 
but drones may increase that number up to 20!

Use autofarm button to develop faster!`;

const about = `Game created: 29.08.2021.

/* 
I published link for the game in my discord group.
Link-invitation: https://discord.gg/tshU2eTt or you can find link under any of my YT videos.

made today:
- more statistics
- autofarm option. Target depends on player rank
- drones (each drone let you buy 2 more guns and shields)

soon: 
- better damage animation

probably (in future):
- menu
- quests
- warranks
- more ships (need images with opacity)
- images for each npc (need images with opacity)

problems:
- background image doesn't load fast on phones

ideas:
- make warranks available for special promocodes
